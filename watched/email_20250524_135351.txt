Subject: Client Sync Meeting Notes

Hi Fred,

The client was frustrated about last week's delay. Anna will draft the Q2
report by next Wednesday.

Schedule a stakeholder sync in early June â€” Johan will do this.

Notify HR about the new intern arriving on June 5.

Best regards,

Michael
