Subject: Client Sync Meeting Notes

Hey Fred,

Please create a calendar invite for our stakeholder meeting next Thursday
at 10am and let the team know via Slack.

Also, the client was frustrated about last week's delay. Anna will draft
the Q2 report by next Wednesday.

Could you please do the following:

- Schedule review call with marketing
- Notify HR about intern arrival
- Update the CRM with today's results

Also, schedule a stakeholder sync in early June â€” Johan will do this.

Notify HR about the new intern arriving on June 5.

Best regards,

Michael
