Hey,

Can you take another look at the numbers from yesterday’s briefing? There’s
a mismatch somewhere in the projections, and finance is breathing down our
necks.

Also, let’s make sure the leadership deck reflects the updated Q2
assumptions — it’s not aligned yet.

Last but not least, Please revise the CRM records and ping the team on
Slack.

Cheers,
Martin
